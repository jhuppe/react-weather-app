This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app gives you the ability to view the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description for the location chosen by the user. If you would like to test out the app, clone the project and obtain an API key from http://openweathermap.org
